                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p><img src="images/marina2013.jpg" alt="marian lupinacci dipretoro" width="130" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="left" />I began playing piano in Bucharest, Romania, where I obtained a Masters Degree in Piano Performance from Ciprian Porumbescu
                    Conservatory. After graduation I began my musical career as a soloist, chamber music pianist, accompanist, and additionally, as a piano teacher.<br />

                    <br /> After emigrating to Israel, I continued my musical career as a pianist and piano teacher. Additionally I played in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan shows, as well as in theatre performances. I then was very fortunate to be able to come
                    to America to pursue a Doctorate in Piano Performance from the West Virginia University. Upon arrival at the university, I won the Concerto Competition and continued my career as a pianist in solo recitals, concertos with orchestra
                    as soloist, chamber music concerts, and accompaniment.<br />

                    <br /> After graduation I moved to Pittsburgh, where I built a very strong piano studio at the City Music Center, Duquesne University. In September of 2006 I moved to the North Hills, where I opened a private piano studio in my new
                    residence. <br />

                    <br /> Throughout the years I have been in this country I played numerous recitals and chamber music concerts, as well as concerts as soloist with orchestras. Several renown musicians have used me as their accompanist and chamber music
                    partner in concerts and recordings: Leone Buyse, Daniel Sinta, as well as several musicians from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra: Cynthia DeAlmeida, James Gorton, Peter Sullivan, Rebecca Cherian, Mark Huggins, Randolph Kelly, Peter
                    Guroff, David Premo, Damian Bursill, Rhian Kenny,and Jennifer Conner, to mention a few.<br />

                    <br /> Between the years 2000 and 2006 I participated as the second keyboard player in many concerts with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. I held piano teaching positions at West Virginia University, Alderson Broadus College, Duquesne
                    University, City Music Center, and Lincoln Park Performing Arts Center. Most of my students are winners of several national and international competitions.

                    <Br/>
                    <Br/> For the past 9 years, I have been part of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Concert Society. In 2009, I was elected President of the Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania.
