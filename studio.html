        <h2>Welcome to My Studio</h2>
        <p>
          Primarily trained as a concert pianist, I taught only occasionally during the first years of my musical
          career. I started a more intense teaching career upon moving to Pittsburgh. I believe there is potential for
          musical development in every student. The successful musical development depend on the teacher&rsquo;s
          understanding of the potential and/or limitations of each student, as well as the dedication of each student,
          and the parental support. It is important for the teacher to communicate clearly the instructions and to point
          out the requirements for the student&rsquo;s daily practice. From ages four to eleven the parental guidance
          and supervision of the daily practice is as important as the teacher&rsquo;s instruction. As the student
          becomes more mature, he or she gains gradually more musical independence and assumes more responsibility in
          his or her musical preparation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Periodical public performances, piano competitions, and piano camps are as important in a student&rsquo;s
          development as the private lessons. Performing in front of people requires a tremendous amount of focus,
          poise, and courage, so it is very important for all the students (as young as four years old) to participate
          in these venues. I organize several recitals every year held at my residence and at the Trombino Piano
          Galleries. I also encourage my students to challenge themselves in piano competitions, locally and nationally.
          Piano camps give students new musical prospective, as well as creating the opportunity to experience new
          teaching methods, understand the level of other students of the same age, learn a large piano repertoire
          through listening to other students and professional pianists recitals, and make new friends.
        </p>
        <h2>For the Parents</h2>
        <p>
          As I mentioned above, the parents contribution to the student's success is crucial. Here are some guidelines
          parents should follow:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. Schedule practice time
            <ol>
              <li>
                - Students are involved in many different activities, so they need to set aside a piano practice time
                for every day of the week.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Practice environment
            <ol>
              <li>
                - Ideally, the piano should be in a separate room. If this is not possible, then during the set practice
                time, the piano room should be quiet, without siblings, phones, TV, or other distractions.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Instrument
            <ol>
              <li>
                - The piano needs to be tuned twice per year. During winter, it is recommended to use a humidifier close
                to the piano.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Supervision
            <ol>
              <li>
                - Parents should closely supervise the student's practice during the first four-five years of training.
                Some parents record the entire lesson; it is a great idea. This way my coaching can be viewed and
                followed every day.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Practice time
            <ol>
              <li>
                - 4-7 years old: 30 to 45 minutes per day<br />
                - 8-10 years old: 60 to 90 minutes per day<br />
                - 11-14 years old: minimum 90 minutes per day<br />
                - 15-18 years old: minimum 2 hours per day
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Practicing means repeating over and over small fragments of the piece, not playing it through once or twice.
        </p>
        <h2>Policies and Fees</h2>

        <p>
          Students will have 30 minues, 45 minutes, or one hour lessons once a week. The duration of the lesson depends
          on the student's level, and it is subject to change as the student becomes more advanced.
        </p>

        <p>
          Payment is due at the beginning of each month for the amount of lessons of the month. Cancelations are
          accepted 24 hours before the scheduled lesson, in which case the canceled lesson is credited for a future
          lesson. Make-up lessons will be sometimes available.
        </p>
